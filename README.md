# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

This is a simple **content-based movie recommender system** built using Python. It recommends similar movies based on the content (genres, cast, director, etc.) of a selected movie.

---

## ðŸ’¡ How it Works

- Uses **TF-IDF** or **CountVectorizer** to convert movie tags into vectors.
- Calculates **cosine similarity** between vectors.
- Recommends the top N similar movies to the one selected.

## ðŸ§  Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn (TF-IDF / CountVectorizer, cosine_similarity)
- Streamlit (for frontend interface)
- Pickle (to store precomputed similarity matrix)
